##KafkaSupervisorIOConfig
|Field|	Type|	Description|	Required|
|-----|---:|---:|:----:|
|||
|topic|String|The Kafka topic to read from. This must be a specific topic as topic patterns are not supported.|yes|
|consumerProperties|Map|A map of properties to be passed to the Kafka consumer. This must contain a property bootstrap.servers with a list of Kafka brokers in the form: <BROKER_1>:<PORT_1>,<BROKER_2>:<PORT_2>,....|yes|
|replicas|Integer|The number of replica sets, where 1 means a single set of tasks (no replication). Replica tasks will always be assigned to different workers to provide resiliency against node failure.|no (default == 1)|
|taskCount|Integer|The maximum number of reading tasks in a replica set. This means that the maximum number of reading tasks will be taskCount * replicas and the total number of tasks (reading + publishing) will be higher than this. See 'Capacity Planning' below for more details. The number of reading tasks will be less than taskCount if taskCount > {numKafkaPartitions}.|no (default == 1)|
|taskDuration|ISO8601 Period|The length of time before tasks stop reading and begin publishing their segment. Note that segments are only pushed to deep storage and loadable by historical nodes when the indexing task completes.|no (default == PT1H)|
|startDelay|ISO8601 Period|The period to wait before the supervisor starts managing tasks.|no (default == PT5S)|
|period|ISO8601 Period|How often the supervisor will execute its management logic. Note that the supervisor will also run in response to certain events (such as tasks succeeding, failing, and reaching their taskDuration) so this value specifies the maximum time between iterations.|no (default == PT30S)|
|useEarliestOffset|Boolean|If a supervisor is managing a dataSource for the first time, it will obtain a set of starting offsets from Kafka. This flag determines whether it retrieves the earliest or latest offsets in Kafka. Under normal circumstances, subsequent tasks will start from where the previous segments ended so this flag will only be used on first run.|no (default == false)|
|completionTimeout|ISO8601 Period|The length of time to wait before declaring a publishing task as failed and terminating it. If this is set too low, your tasks may never publish. The publishing clock for a task begins roughly after taskDuration elapses.|no (default == PT30M)|
|lateMessageRejectionPeriod|ISO8601 Period|Configure tasks to reject messages with timestamps earlier than this period before the task was created; for example if this is set to PT1H and the supervisor creates a task at 2016-01-01T12:00Z, messages with timestamps earlier than 2016-01-01T11:00Z will be dropped. This may help prevent concurrency issues if your data stream has late messages and you have multiple pipelines that need to operate on the same segments (e.g. a realtime and a nightly batch ingestion pipeline).|no (default == none)|
|earlyMessageRejectionPeriod|ISO8601 Period|Configure tasks to reject messages with timestamps later than this period after the task reached its taskDuration; for example if this is set to PT1H, the taskDuration is set to PT1H and the supervisor creates a task at 2016-01-01T12:00Z, messages with timestamps later than 2016-01-01T14:00Z will be dropped.|no (default == none)|
|skipOffsetGaps|Boolean|Whether or not to allow gaps of missing offsets in the Kafka stream. This is required for compatibility with implementations such as MapR Streams which does not guarantee consecutive offsets. If this is false, an exception will be thrown if offsets are not consecutive.|no (default == false)
